# Structure
The backend is divided into folders, each with a specific purpose:

- **controller**: Contains code for handling requests and performing necessary actions.
- **databases**: Handles database connections.
- **routers**: Redirects requests to the appropriate handler functions.
- **utils**: General-purpose code, such as libraries for handling JSON responses.

# Important Files
The project contains a few key files:

- **app.js**: The entry point for the backend API. It starts the server, sets up essential features, and defines the main routes.
